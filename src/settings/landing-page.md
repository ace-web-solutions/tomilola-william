    Never take a woman word serious. Always look at her action(s).


    One moment she is saying something, another time, she doing contradict to what she is saying. 


    It is why a woman can promise to always love you and never to leave you; two minutes later, she never thinks you exist. 


    A woman can say she hates this particular friend of yours, two months later, you caught her riding your guy's dccck. 


    Women don't mean what they say. 


    Always do the opposite of anything they say--in there, lies the magic
